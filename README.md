# rustnbt

Minecraft NBT format library.

https://wiki.vg/NBT <br>
https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/NBT_format

This implements Minecraft's NBT format, then adds some tags to the format.

```
At some point in the future, I hope to write up a spec for the extensions, but it is a logical extension of Minecraft's NBT.

One thing to note is that the extension types have IDs that start at `128`. This is to attempt to prevent collisions with any potential future additions to Minecraft's NBT specification.

### Reason

I needed a library that could serialize and deserialize NBT, and I didn't want to use someone else's library, so I wrote my own and then added some extra functionality as the cherry on top.<br>
Although I wrote it for my own purposes, you are free to use it for your own.

## Before Use

If you prefer that the order of elements in a Compound tag are preserved, you can add the `preserve_order` feature.
This feature will use [indexmap](https://docs.rs/indexmap/latest/indexmap/) to preserve order. This adds a small toll to the size of the Tag enum type, and also incurs a small performance penalty. Minecraft does not specify that tags must be in any particular order, so it is merely a matter of preference. This feature is off by default.<br>
If you would like to try out the tag type extensions, you will need the `extensions` feature enabled. These are experimental extensions to Minecraft's NBT format, and I do not advise you to use it in production code. They were merely added into the library because I found that I could without having to write a bunch of extra code to support them.

# Example Usage

## Creating Tags.

```rs
let byte = Tag::Byte(i8::MAX);
let short = Tag::Short(i16::MAX);
let int = Tag::Int(69420);
let long = Tag::Long(i64::MAX);
let float = Tag::Float(3.14_f32);
let double = Tag::Double(3.14159265358979_f64);
let bytearray = Tag::ByteArray(vec![1,2,3,4]);
let string = Tag::String(String::from("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogðŸŽˆðŸŽ„"));
let list = Tag::List(ListTag::from(vec!["One".to_owned(),"Two".to_owned(), "Three".to_owned()]));
let intarray = Tag::IntArray(vec![1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144]);
let longarray = Tag::LongArray(
    (0..8)
        .map(|i| (0xFu64 << i) as i64 )
        .collect()
);
// There are alternate ways to create a Tag::Compound. There is also a macro. More on that later.
let compound = Tag::Compound(Map::from([
    ("Byte".to_owned(), byte),
    ("Short".to_owned(), short),
    ("Int".to_owned(), int),
    ("Long".to_owned(), long),
    ("Float".to_owned(), float),
    ("Double".to_owned(), double),
    ("ByteArray".to_owned(), bytearray),
    ("String".to_owned(), string),
    ("List".to_owned(), list),
    ("Compound".to_owned(), Tag::Compound(Map::from([
        ("One".to_owned(), 1.into()),
        ("Two".to_owned(), 2.into()),
        ("Three".to_owned(), 3.into()),
        ("True".to_owned(), true.into()),
        ("False".to_owned(), false.into()),
        ("Empty List".to_owned(), Tag::List(ListTag::Empty)),
    ]))),
    ("IntArray".to_owned(), intarray),
    ("LongArray".to_owned(), longarray),
]));
// So let's say you want to create a compound, but you don't want to have
// to type String::from/to_string/to_owned/etc and Tag::from/into/etc.
// Well the compound macro makes it easy to create compound tags
// without hurting your pwecious wittle fingy wingies.
let compound = compound!(
    ("One", 1),
    ("Two".to_owned(), Tag::Byte(2)),
    ("String", "Hello, world!")
);
// There is also a macro for Tag::List, but I don't feel like documenting
// it right now. Oh, alright. Fine. I'll tell show you.
let list_int = list!(
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4
);
// Unfortunately, it won't work with string literals â˜¹
// Just kidding! Yes it will!
let list_string = list!(
    "One",
    "Two",
    "Three",
    "Four"
);
```

## Reading NBT from a file

```rs
let mut file = File::open(path).expect("Failed to open the file.");
// Get the file size to find an appropriate buffer size.
let size = file.metadata().expect("Failed to unwrap metadata.").len() as usize;
// Max buffer size is 4mib
let buffer_capacity = size.min(rustnbt::mebibytes(4));
let mut reader = BufReader::with_capacity(buffer_capacity, file);
// Attempts to read a NamedTag from the reader.
// A NamedTag is a special type that holds a String name and a Tag.
// This is used to read the format that most NBT is written to file.
let root = reader.read_nbt().expect("Failed to read NBT.");
```

### You can also access the tag through a reference:

```rs
// Get a refernece to the tag
let tag_ref: &Tag = root.tag();
// Get a mutable reference to the tag
let tag_ref_mut: &mut Tag = root.tag_mut();
// Get the tag itself, consuming the NamedTag in the process
let tag: Tag = root.take_tag();
```

### Or if you need to, you can decompose the NamedTag into a tuple:

```rs
let (name, tag) = <(String, Tag)>::from(root);
```

## Writing NBT to a file

```rs
let mut file = File::create(path).expect("Failed to create the file.");
// Restrict buffer capacity to 4mib.
let root_size = root.nbt_size();
let buffer_capacity = root_size.min(rustnbt::mebibytes(4));
let mut writer = BufWriter::with_capacity(buffer_capacity, file);
let bytes_written = writer.write_nbt(&root).expect("Failed to write NBT.");
println!("Wrote {} bytes.", bytes_written);
```

## Other stuff

If for whatever reason you want to know how large a Tag is when serialized, you can get that information with `NbtSize::nbt_size`.
`NbtSize` is a trait that is implemented for all NBT tag types, as well as for `Tag` and `NamedTag`.
This will tell you exactly how many bytes will be written when an NBT object is written to a writer.
